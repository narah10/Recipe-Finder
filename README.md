# Overview

I'm a web developer with a passion for learning and improving. I built this recipe finder website, Dish Dive, and it's inspired me to stay updated on the latest web technologies and best practices. My goal is to create more user-friendly web applications as I continue to grow in the field of software engineering.

I developed a recipe finder application as a demonstration of my proficiency in the JavaScript language. This web application allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. It utilizes an API from Edamam.com to retrieve and display a wide array of recipes, offering users a diverse range of culinary choices. The project showcases my skills in JavaScript and API integration, enabling a seamless and user-friendly experience for those seeking culinary inspiration from their available ingredients.
